# Project Rules for `@kevinoyl/lasereyes-core`

This document outlines the guidelines and standards for contributing to the `@kevinoyl/lasereyes-core` package. Following these rules will ensure consistency, maintainability, and quality throughout the project.

## 🌟 Overview

`@kevinoyl/lasereyes-core` is a framework-agnostic library designed to provide Bitcoin wallet integration for dApps. It abstracts wallet-specific interactions and offers a unified interface for working with various Bitcoin wallets.

## 📋 General Code Guidelines

1. **TypeScript Required**: All code must be written in TypeScript with proper type definitions.
2. **Clean Code**: Follow clean code principles - meaningful variable names, clear functions, and appropriate comments.
3. **No `any` Types**: Avoid using `any` type. Use proper typing or `unknown` when necessary.
4. **ESLint**: All code must pass ESLint checks using the project's configuration.
5. **Documentation**: All public methods, classes, and interfaces must be documented with TSDoc comments.
6. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and provide meaningful error messages.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

1. **Module Organization**:
   - `/src/client`: Contains the client-facing API
   - `/src/lib`: Shared utilities and helpers
   - `/src/constants`: Project constants
   - `/src/types`: TypeScript type definitions

2. **Exports**:
   - Export only what's necessary in `index.ts`
   - Internal utilities should not be exposed

## 📐 Architecture Guidelines

1. **Provider Pattern**:
   - Each wallet provider must implement the `WalletProvider` interface
   - Providers must handle their specific wallet interactions
   - All providers should be registered in `LaserEyesClient`

2. **Client Implementation**:
   - The `LaserEyesClient` should maintain a unified interface
   - Wallet-specific logic should be abstracted away in providers
   - Client methods should proxy to the appropriate provider methods

3. **Error Management**:
   - Use consistent error types across providers
   - Normalize errors from different wallet implementations

## 🔄 State Management

1. **Store Usage**:
   - Use nanostores for state management
   - Keep state atomized and focused
   - Avoid storing sensitive information in state

2. **Events**:
   - Handle wallet connection events appropriately
   - Propagate events through the client interface

## 🧪 Testing Standards

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - All core functionality must have unit tests
   - Mock external wallet dependencies for testing
   - Test edge cases and error handling

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test integration with mock wallet providers
   - Ensure proper state management and event propagation

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

1. **Branching Strategy**:
   - Feature branches should be created from `main`
   - Use meaningful branch names: `feature/wallet-integration`, `fix/error-handling`, etc.

2. **Commits**:
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Reference issues in commit messages when applicable

3. **Pull Requests**:
   - PRs should include a clear description of changes
   - All PRs must pass CI checks before merging
   - PRs should be reviewed by at least one team member

## 📦 Package Management

1. **Dependencies**:
   - Keep dependencies minimal and up-to-date
   - Avoid adding dependencies for simple utilities
   - Consider bundle size impact when adding dependencies

2. **Versioning**:
   - Follow semantic versioning
   - Document breaking changes in CHANGELOG.md

## 🌍 Wallet Support Guidelines

1. **Adding New Wallets**:
   - Create a new provider class that extends `WalletProvider`
   - Implement all required methods
   - Add wallet constants to the constants file
   - Register the provider in `LaserEyesClient`
   - Add tests for the new provider

2. **Wallet Features**:
   - Support basic operations (connect, disconnect, sign)
   - Implement advanced features when available (inscriptions, runes)
   - Handle wallet-specific error scenarios

## 🌐 Network Support

1. **Multiple Networks**:
   - Support mainnet, testnet, and other networks
   - Properly handle network switching
   - Maintain network state in the client

## 📊 Data Sources

1. **Data Source Architecture**:
   - Follow the Data Source Manager pattern for accessing external APIs
   - All data sources must implement the `DataSource` interface
   - Use the manager to handle fallbacks between different data sources

2. **Adding New Data Sources**:
   - Create a new data source class that implements the `DataSource` interface
   - Implement required methods based on the capabilities of the API
   - Register the data source in the `DataSourceManager`
   - Add appropriate normalization functions for the data returned

3. **Data Normalization**:
   - Always normalize responses from different data sources into standard formats
   - Use helper functions in the normalization module
   - Handle edge cases where data may be missing or in unexpected formats

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement proper error handling for API failures
   - Use fallback mechanisms when primary data sources are unavailable
   - Log meaningful error messages when data source operations fail

## 📃 Documentation Requirements

1. **API Documentation**:
   - Document all public methods, interfaces, and types
   - Include examples in comments for complex methods

2. **README**:
   - Keep the README up-to-date with new features
   - Document supported wallets and networks
   - Include basic usage examples
